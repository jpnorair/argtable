# About Argtable for HB

You can read all about [argtable3](https://www.argtable.org), which is the basis for this project.

**Argtable for HB** is just like the reference library (above) except:

* It uses the HB build and packaging system
* There are some minor compatibility improvements

A complete list of projects that build into HB is available in the [hbdist repository](https://github.com/jpnorair/hbdist) (see Readme).
